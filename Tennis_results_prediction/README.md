# Tennis results prediction - Can the outcome of a match be deduced from its statistics?

## Overview and objectives

In this project, which was my first project in Data Science, I was interested in **tennis and its statistics**. More precisely, I wanted to know if we could **predict the outcome of a match from its statistics**.

To do this, I worked with data regarding **all matches on the men's professional circuit between 2000 and 2017**.

## Adaptability

Whether it was the variables selected, the graphs or the machine learning models, all were purely **personal choices**. Feel free to try to do the project again from a different angle!

## Files

Besides the **notebook**, the only file you'll need for this project is the **dataset**. It is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gmadevs/atp-matches-dataset).

Nonetheless, please note that the version used in the notebook is a **cleaned compilation of the 18 separate documents available on Kaggle**. This "custom" version is available in the **same folder as the notebook**. You'll have to download in order to run the notebook! Unless you prefer constituting your own dataset, of course!

## Required libraries

This project uses two libraries for data manipulation, namely **Pandas** and **NumPy**, three packages for visualization: **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** and **Squarify**, as well as **sklearn** for machine learning tasks.

Depending on your execution environment, you might need to **install these modules**. As a reminder, you can do so using a `pip install name_of_the_library` command. Remember to add an exclamation mark at the beginning if you want to execute it directly in a notebook, as it is originally a terminal command.
