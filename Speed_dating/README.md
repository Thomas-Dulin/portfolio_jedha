# Speed Dating - How to Get a Second Date?

## Overview and objectives

This project seeks to question **one of the fundamental concepts of humanity: love**. Is love based on tangible and measurable elements, or does it remain an area shrouded in mystery?

More concretely, this project will be based on data collected by Columbia Business School professors **Ray Fisman** and **Sheena Iyengar** during a **speed dating experiment** conducted between 2002 and 2004. The aim is to use **data exploration and visualization** to understand what goes on behind the scenes of a speed dating event and what influences **whether or not a second date is obtained**.

## Files

Besides the notebook, **two additional files** are provided:

- The **dataset** used for this project, which is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment), in CSV format.

- A **PDF document providing more information on the different variables of the dataset**. This document was initially available on Kaggle as well, but it doesn't seem to be the case anymore.

## Required libraries

This project uses two libraries for data manipulation, namely **Pandas** and **NumPy**, as well as three packages for visualization: **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** and **Plotly**.

Depending on your execution environment, you might need to install these modules. As a reminder, you can do so using a `pip install *name_of_the_library*` command. Remember to add an exclamation mark at the beginning if you want to execute it directly in a notebook, as it is originally a terminal command.
