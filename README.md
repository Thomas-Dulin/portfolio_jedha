# Portfolio

*I gathered here all the projects I worked on during my FullStack and Essentials' Data Science trainings at [Jedha](https://www.jedha.co/).*

## Building a quiz

In this project, I built a **3-question quiz** parametered with a limited number of tries, using only Python objects and methods.

## Speed dating - How to get a second date?

This **data exploration and visualization** project aimed at exploring a vast and mysterious subject: **love**. Could data analysis help us understand what happens during a **speed dating event**, and which elements influence the fact of **getting (or not) a second date**?

## Tennis results prediction - Can the outcome of a match be deduced from its statistics?

This was my very first Data Science project. Its objective, as the title implies, was to investigate the **links between the statistics of a tennis match and its outcome**. It was a good opportunity to practice both data visualization and machine learning!

## Trip planning - Prepare your next holiday!

Want to get some fresh air and take a few days off next week? Thanks to **APIs** and **web scraping**, we'll compile a **list of the best destinations to go to** and **the best hotels to stay in**!
